What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value ? What do we try to control on ?

---> The different values we use to multiply each level help us control the weights.
In fact, we can control each band of frequencies (with these coefficients) that the Laplacian
level we would like to have in the final image we will receive.
They are binary coefficients : 0 -> we don't want that level, 1 -> we want that level
More over, the bigger is the coefficient the frequencies in this level will be higher.
