What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when :
Blending is performed with differents image filters (filter_size_im = 1, 3, 5, 7...)

---> When we do a blending action using different sizes for the filter, the quality of the blended image changes
a few. Smaller is the filter, less blurred is the image.
