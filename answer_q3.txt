What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when :
Blending is performed with a variying number of pyramid levels(max_levels = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...)

---> When we do a blending operation using different sizes of pyramid levels, the pyramid is more
blend. In fact, we build the pyramid to have the highest level with the lowest frequencies
to then reconstruct using the mask edges(softer)
And with a small size, we will have sharper images.
